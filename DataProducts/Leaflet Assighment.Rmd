## Leaflet in R Markdown

This R Markdown document has a marker at the location of each one of the states in the USA, additionally the marker's popup indicates the name of the state. You can get the data from: <https://www.kaggle.com/washimahmed/usa-latlong-for-state-abbreviations/version/1>.



```{r cars}

statelatlong <- read_csv("statelatlong.csv")
statelatlong %>% 
    leaflet() %>% 
    addTiles() %>% 
    addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
               popup = statelatlong$City)
```
